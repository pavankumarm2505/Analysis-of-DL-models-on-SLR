**Analysis of Deep Learning Models on Sign Language Detection**

This repository contains the code, datasets, and documentation for the project "Analysis of DL Models on Sign Language Detection", conducted from January to April 2023 as part of coursework.

Project Overview  
Sign language is a primary form of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. This project aims to bridge the communication gap by developing and analyzing deep learning models for recognizing sign language alphabets.

**Models Used:**

A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)  
Pre-trained ResNet50V2

**Datasets:**  
**American Sign Language (ASL)**: 87,000 images across 29 classes.  
**Arabic Sign Language (AASL)**: 7,857 images collected under diverse conditions.

**Key Outcomes**:  
99.73% accuracy on the ASL dataset.  
78.77% accuracy on the AASL dataset.

**Features**

* Comparative study of Baseline CNN and ResNet50V2 models.  
* Hyperparameter optimization and data augmentation for performance enhancement.  
* Detailed evaluation with training, validation, and test accuracies.
